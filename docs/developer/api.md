# API Overview

Welcome to the **MMTC** API documentation. This section provides detailed information about the API endpoints, parameters, request and response formats, and example usage. Use this guide to integrate **MMTC** with your applications and services.

## Getting Started

Before using the API, ensure that you have:

- **API Key**: You need an API key to authenticate your requests. You can obtain one by [registering an account](#) on our platform.
- **Base URL**: All API endpoints are accessible via the following base URL:
  ```
  https://api.mmtc.com/v1
  ```
- **Authentication**: Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
  ```

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

All requests to the **MMTC** API must include an API key for authentication. Here's how to include your API key in the header:

```http
GET /v1/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: api.mmtc.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. Below are the common status codes you might encounter:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: The resource was successfully created.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed or user does not have permissions.
- **403 Forbidden**: The user does not have access rights to the content.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an error and could not complete your request.
