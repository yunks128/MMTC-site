# Getting Started with Development

Welcome to the development guide for MMTC! This document will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment, understanding the project structure, and getting started with coding, testing, and contributing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS (Big Sur+), Windows 10+
- **Programming Language**: Node.js 14+, Python 3.8+
- **Package Manager**: npm, Yarn, pip
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Other Tools**: Docker, PostgreSQL

> _Ensure that you have the correct versions of these tools to avoid compatibility issues._

## Project Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

First, fork the MMTC repository to your own GitHub account. Then, clone your fork to your local development machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mmtc.git
cd mmtc
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# For Node.js projects
yarn install
# or
npm install

# For Python projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> _Refer to the project's documentation for specific instructions if additional dependencies or configurations are required._

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to configure your environment variables. You can copy the example file provided in the repository:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to match your development setup:

```bash
# Example
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mmtc_db
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### 4. Initialize the Database

If your project requires a database, set it up by running the necessary migration scripts or seeding commands:

```bash
# Example for Node.js projects
yarn run migrate

# Example for Python projects
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the development server to begin working on the project:

```bash
# For Node.js projects
yarn start
# or
npm start

# For Python projects
python manage.py runserver
```

### 6. Contributing
