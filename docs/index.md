# Welcome to the MMTC Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **MMTC (Multi-Mission Time Correlation)**, a NASA AMMOS component developed by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL). MMTC performs time correlation between spacecraft clocks and ground time for space missions, designed to be mission-independent and adaptable to different spacecraft and ground systems.

## What is MMTC?

MMTC is specialized software that:
- Associates spacecraft clock (SCLK) values with ground time (TDT)
- Calculates clock drift rates
- Processes telemetry data from spacecraft
- Generates standard time correlation products (SCLK Kernels, SCLK/SCET files, etc.)

## Documentation Contents

- **[Installation](installation):** Requirements and step-by-step instructions for installing MMTC on RHEL 8/9 or as a tar.gz archive.
- **[Configuration](configuration):** Detailed guidance on configuring MMTC for your specific mission using XML configuration files.
- **[User Guide](user):** Comprehensive instructions for operating MMTC, including workflows from telemetry querying to product generation.
- **[Architecture](architecture):** Overview of MMTC's system architecture, including its plugin system and key components.
- **[Telemetry Sources](telemetry-sources):** Information about available telemetry source plugins and how to implement custom plugins.
- **[Filters](filters):** Documentation on MMTC's various quality filters for ensuring reliable time correlation.
- **[Output Products](output-products):** Details about the time correlation products generated by MMTC.
- **[Clock Rate Computation](clock-rate):** Explanation of the different methods for computing clock change rates.
- **[Developer Guide](developer):** Resources for developers looking to extend or modify MMTC.
- **[API Reference](api):** Documentation of MMTC's Java interfaces for integration with other systems.
- **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting):** Common issues and their solutions.
- **[FAQ](faqs):** Frequently asked questions about MMTC operation and configuration.
- **[Changelog](changelog):** Record of updates and improvements to the MMTC software.

## Key Features

- Command-line Java application with configurable XML settings
