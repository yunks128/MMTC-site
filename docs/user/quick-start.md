# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Quick Start Guide for MMTC! This guide will help you get up and running with the MMTC project in just a few simple steps. If you haven't already installed the software, please refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/user/installation.md) before proceeding.

## Step 1: Basic Configuration

After installing MMTC, you'll need to perform some basic configuration to get started.

### Using Environment Variables

Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration details, such as database connections or API keys relevant to MMTC.

### Using a Configuration File

Alternatively, you can use a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`, `settings.yaml`) to manage your settings. Refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/user/installation.md) for detailed instructions.

## Step 2: Running the Software

With the installation and basic configuration complete, you're ready to start MMTC.

### For Development

To run the software in a development environment:

```bash
# For Node.js projects
npm start
# or
yarn start

# For Python projects
python main.py
```

This will start the application locally, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port, depending on your configuration).

### For Production

If you're deploying MMTC to a production environment, ensure you've built the project:

```bash
# For Node.js projects
npm run build
# or
yarn build

# Then start the production server
npm run serve
# or
yarn serve
```

Refer to the [Installation Guide](/docs/user/installation.md) for more details.
