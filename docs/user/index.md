# MMTC User Documentation

Welcome to the User Documentation for the Multi-Mission Time Correlation (MMTC) software. This section provides comprehensive guidance for mission operations teams using MMTC to manage spacecraft time correlation. Whether you're implementing MMTC for a new mission or operating an existing MMTC deployment, you'll find the resources you need here.

## Introduction

MMTC is a NASA AMMOS component developed by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) that performs time correlation between spacecraft clocks and ground time. It processes telemetry data to extract timing information, calculates clock drift rates, and generates standardized time correlation products essential for mission operations. This documentation will guide you through configuring, operating, and troubleshooting MMTC for your specific mission requirements.

### What's Covered

- System requirements for operational deployment
- Installing MMTC from RPM packages (RHEL 8/9)
- Installing from tar.gz archives (alternative environments)
- Directory structure and file organization
- Verifying installation and initial setup
- Setting up proper file permissions and access controls

## Configuration Guide

The [Configuration Guide](configuration) walks you through the process of adapting MMTC to your specific spacecraft and mission requirements.

### What's Covered

- Setting up `TimeCorrelationConfigProperties.xml`
