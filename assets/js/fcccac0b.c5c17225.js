It encompasses continuous testing concepts such as testing across the software development lifecycle as well as automated execution of tests through automation.\n\n---\n\n## Testing Categories\n\nThe below list of test categories are included in our testing setup. Further details are provided below.\n\n- [ ] **Static Code Analysis:** checks code for syntax, style, vulnerabilities, and bugs\n- [ ] **Unit Tests:** tests functions or components to verify that they perform as intended\n- [ ] **Security Tests:** identifies potential security vulnerabilities\n- [ ] **Build Tests:** checks if the code builds into binaries or packages successfully\n- [ ] **Acceptance Tests:** validates against end-user & stakeholder requirements\n- [ ] **Integration Tests:** ensures that different modules work together as expected\n- [ ] **System Tests:** validates the complete and integrated software product\n- [ ] **Performance Tests:** assesses the speed, scalability, and stability characteristics of the application\n- [ ] **Usability Tests:** evaluates the user interface and user experience\n- [ ] **Regression Tests:** ensures that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionalities\n- [ ] **Smoke Tests:** preliminary tests to check the basic functionality of the application\n\n### Unit Tests\n\n- Location: `tests/unit/`\n- Purpose: Verify that individual functions and components perform as intended.\n- Running Tests:\n  - Manually:\n    1. Navigate to the `tests/unit/` directory.\n    2. Run the command `npm test` or `pytest` depending on the framework used.\n    3. View results in the console output.\n  - Automatically:\n    - Frequency:\n      - Tests are triggered on every code commit.\n      - Tests run nightly as part of the CI/CD pipeline.\n    - Results Location: `build/test-results/`\n- Contributing:\n  - Framework Used: Jest for JavaScript or Pytest for Python.\n  - Tips:\n    - Ensure that all new features include corresponding unit tests.\n    - Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions for consistency.\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n- Location: `tests/integration/`\n- Purpose: Ensure that different modules work together as expected.\n- Running Tests:\n  - Manually:\n    1. Navigate to the `tests/integration/` directory.\n    2. Run the command `npm run integration-test` or `pytest integration_tests.py`.\n    3. View results in the console output.\n  - Automatically:\n    - Frequency:\n      - Tests are triggered on every pull request.\n      - Tests run weekly as part of the CI/CD pipeline.\n    - Results Location: `build/integration-test-results/`\n- Contributing:\n  - Framework Used: Mocha for JavaScript or Unittest for Python.\n  - Tips:\n    - Write integration tests for any new features that involve multiple components.\n    - Ensure that integration tests cover edge cases and failure scenarios.\n\n### Performance Tests\n\n- Location: `tests/performance/`\n- Purpose: Assess the speed, scalability, and stability characteristics of the application.\n- Running Tests:\n  - Manually:\n    1. Navigate to the `tests/performance/` directory.\n    2. Run the command `npm run performance-test` or `pytest performance_tests.py`.\n    3. View results in the console output.\n  - Automatically:\n    - Frequency:\n      - Tests are triggered on a monthly basis.\n    - Results Location: `build/performance-test-results/`\n- Contributing:\n  - Framework Used: JMeter or Locust.\n  - Tips:\n    - Include performance tests for critical user journeys.\n    - Monitor performance metrics and set benchmarks for future tests.\n"})})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>a});var s=n(6540);const o={},i=s.createContext(o);function r(e){const t=s.useContext(i);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:r(e.components),s.createElement(i.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
